# CSCI-3202-Intro-to-AI
Artificial Intelligence class taken Fall 2019

Homework 1: This assignment went through different searches (AStar, Breadth First Search, etc) to find the end goal for a Pacman in a PacMan-style maze. Please note that the assignment did not actually do some of the items in the test cases, but that is what happens when a teacher reworks an assignment.

Homework 2: This assignment built a genetic algorithm to make Robby the Robot learn to pick up cans and not ram into walls over multiple generations. This was split into two parts, the first to build in skill before promoting yourself to working with Robby.

Homework 3: This assignment used SciKit-Learn to teach various aspects of various machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and SVM. I did not 100% complete the assignment, however, due to time constraints with other classes and work. I did complete the most important parts and worked with the algorithms, however.

Homework 4: This assignment had me build a Hopfield network to attempt to distinguish between 2's and 5's, comparing drawn ones to 'perfect' ones (those found on a digital clock). It then compared that to a stronger network in SciKit-Learn's MLP Classifier

Homework 5: This assignment went over deep learning, using Keras for the purpose of facial recognition. Updated code was A5, with getData used to get the faces and a sample I was supposed to use to help me figure it out, but I forgot it existed until uploading here.
