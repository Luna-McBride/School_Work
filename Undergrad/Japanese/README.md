# Japanese

These are all of the Japanese assignments I found left over on my system. The Japanese classes do not fit the same structure as the computer science classes (following a book and utilizing mostly physical learning mediums,) so there is not much on the computer to contend with. These few assignments are the culmination of many years of Japanese classes.
