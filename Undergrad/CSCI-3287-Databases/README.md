# CSCI-3287-Databases-
  This is a repository documenting the assignments from my Database class from Fall 2018. This includes the assignments
as issued in the Assignments folder and my submitted answers in the Homework folder

  Regrettably, as I decided to compile these into github much later than I honestly should have, I do not have the databases.
In addition, due to a huge issue with my computer breaking and needing to be replaced around the time of Homework 2, I do not
have access to the uploaded file nor the assignment itself. The computer it was done on had promply deleted it, as it was not
mine to store it on for months at a time. I do, however, hope this is able to illustrate what was done in this class.
