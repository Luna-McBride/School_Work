Time taken: 5 hr 32 Minutes

General Info:
Arrow keys: move scene
0: reset scene position
q: reset the parameters.

Regular Scenes:
1: set to mode 1 (default) (only alter S). 
2: set to mode 2 (only alter B).
3: set to mode 3 (only alter R).
4: Alter all 3 (s,b,r) at once.
=: increases a parameter (s in mode 1, b in mode 2, r in mode 3, all in the rest)
   (= is the same button as plus, but you have to press shift to register
    + and not so for -, so for consistency sake, = is used in the code).
-: decreases a parameter (s in mode 1, b in mode 2, r in mode 3, all in the rest)

Art Scenes:
I altered the rotation settings within the Lorenz for loop while playing around
with this and accidentally made art. After which, I made some more. 5-9 shall 
be such art (warning: some are painful to the eyes. Also, I am bad at naming).
I also removed the axies so they can be seen well.
(if you alter any of the parameters in one, remember to press q to reset and
see the initial picture. The values do carry over.)
5: "Swirls and Twirls"
6: "The Eternal Star"
7: "Fill in the Bubble"
8: "Firework Show" (press = a couple times to see why I call it that)
9: "The Universal Doughnut"
