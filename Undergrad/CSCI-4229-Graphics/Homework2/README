About:
    This project was used with a heavy emphasis on the first person
view. There is a box that follows the player that is essentially a skybox,
using the sides to kind of emulate a fog effect as the player gets closer
to the objects. Note that I am also treating the Orthogonal and Perspective
views as kind of a developer's platform for tree placement and such while
the first person is the "actual game" (I am also thinking of this as if it
is a game of sorts). The orthogonal view also does not really show the 
skybox's sky while the perspective does, giving an interesting look into
the actual geometry.
    Items: 
        Sphere: Bush 
        Cone: Pine Trees
        Complex Combination of Cyllendar (if thats how you spell it) and
            half circles: Those fat palm trees
    They would look better with textures and lighting, but this makes a good
forest and testing area for polygon count, first person camera, and the skybox.
