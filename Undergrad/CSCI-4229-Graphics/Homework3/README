Textures pulled off google

About:
    Note: Texture will not be applied to the center target because the target
already has the desired effect (in being a target). I scrapped the Orthogonal
view because I saw it unnecessary here. 

Order of Items: Skybox (its pretty), Bush, Circle, Ground, Trunk, Leaf (I like it
because it looks like a watermelon yet still fits), Pine tree, Palm Tree 

I have been having troubles with the bush (sphere). I could not get any textures
to look good. I am already past the deadline currently and just have not been able
to get it. The lighting seems right, though
