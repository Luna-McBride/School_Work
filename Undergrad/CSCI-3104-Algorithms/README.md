# CSCI-3104-Algorithms

This is the homework for my algorithms class, taken Fall, 2019. It includes all 10 homework assignments as well as the final. The homeworks were split into two parts by the instructor, hence the A and B parts. I also have taken the liberty to include the graded version, as a reminder of where I could improve.

Also, please do not mind homework 10 being up near homework 1. Github organizes it character at a time, so the 1 in 10 is earlier than 2. It annoys me too, but just ignore it.
