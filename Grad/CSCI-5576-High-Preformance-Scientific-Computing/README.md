# CSCI 5576: High-Performance Scientific Computing

These are the labs completed for the Fall 2023 version of the class. All labs have documentation PDF files in their directories. There was an attempt made to have the PDFs load automatically in their individual README files, but such allowances appear to be browser-specific (namely due to Chrome not inherently trusting embed and IFrame HTML tags.) The PDFs should pop up automatically if accessed on the correct browser. If not, a link is provided to access it.
