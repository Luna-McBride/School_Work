    "### Introduction to Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scikit-learn** is an important machine learning library in Python that we will use througout the semester. It is known for its wide range of algorithms and utilities for almost every standard machine learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Workflow with Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparing Data:** (already done above)\n",
    "    - Begin by organizing your data. Typically in machine learning, especially with `scikit-learn`, you'll have input data referred to as `X` and labels referred to as `y`. Here, `X` is a matrix where each row is a sample and each column is a feature. In contrast, `y` is a vector of labels corresponding to each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Splitting Data:**\n",
    "    - Divide your dataset into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to teach your model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its generalization performance (i.e., risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining the Model:**\n",
    "    - Choose the algorithm that best fits your task. For this assignment, you'll be working with the Bernoulli naive Bayes classifier. In `scikit-learn`, each algorithm is implemented as a class. To use it, you'll first instantiate it, resulting in what's commonly referred to as a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training the Model:**\n",
    "    - Once you've chosen a model, the next step is to train it using your training data. This is typically done using a method called `fit()`, where you'll pass in your training data and corresponding labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluating the Model:**\n",
    "    - After training, you'll want to see how well your model performs. You can achieve this by making predictions on your testing data and comparing those predictions to the actual labels. Many metrics can be used for evaluation, with accuracy being one of the most common for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the key to mastering machine learning and `scikit-learn` is practice. As you experiment with different algorithms and datasets, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and the nuances of each method."
