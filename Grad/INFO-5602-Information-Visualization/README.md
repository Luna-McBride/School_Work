# INFO-5602: Information Visualization

These are the assignments from my Information Visualization class from Spring, 2024. These assignments consist of several research paper evaluations, chart evaluations, and coding assignments using Seaborn. There were two major projects, one being in this directory consisting of fixing bad charts from the real world. The other was the Medicaid Dashboard, which has its own directory on my profile (https://github.com/Luna-McBride/Medicaid_Analysis).
